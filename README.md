# RiQualis-Dataset
Dataset of Lachkari Kolam Rice and Basmati Rice for estimation of Rice Quality using Image processing and Machine Learning. (Part of a research project developed under guidance of Debanjan Sir and Venkanna Sir of IIIT Naya Raipur).
A total of 200 images exist in this dataset.

_**Dataset Description:**_
The dataset contains images of rice grains along with a Rs. 2 coin of 25 mm diameter as a reference object for precise measurement of physical features.
There are two folders namely Lachkari Kolam Rice and Basmati Rice indicating the variety of rice in the folder. (100 images of each type)
In each folder there are 6 folders out of which 5 contain 20 images each and the 6th folder contains the CSV files describing the features of each quality of rice.
The dataset was made by damaging rice and creating a set of Good rice (High quality rice obtained from market) and Bad rice (Damaged rice by breaking kernels manually and discoloring some kernels).
The number of grains in each image is not constant. However 5 measures of 1/8<sup>th</sup> teaspoon are present in each image.
A 5 star rating scale has been employed to differentiate quality and the proportions of good rice and bad rice in an image has been varied to account for varying quality.
Each folder containing images also contains the corresponding CSV file with the features and quality similar to the one in the parent folder.
The images have been clicked using mobile phones with the mobile phone being approximately parallel to the surface but at varying distances and illumination while keeping the image as clear as possible.
The features present are Length, Breadth, Eccentricty, Area, LB ratio, and Average RGB values.
